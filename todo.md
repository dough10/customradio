# TODO

- [ ] Create a script that takes current `inList` stat for a station and uses the popularity calculator to convert it to play minutes and rewrite it to the database
- [ ] Better station adding — allow changing of station name when adding a station
- [ ] Option to "minimize" a user's list to prevent users from having to scroll past it to get to search results

## Before next release

- [x] Script that generates translation files
- [x] User menu — login button when logged out, logout button when logged in
- [ ] Set up WorkOS production environment
- [ ] refactor header so that user menu is not hidden on mobile. maybe shift input block right to allow space for use of the button. refactor js to have seperate behavior for the buttons
