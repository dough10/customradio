# TODO

- [ ] Create a script that takes current `inList` stat for a station and uses the popularity calculator to convert it to play minutes and rewrite it to the database
- [ ] Better station adding — allow changing of station name when adding a station
- [ ] Option to "minimize" a user's list to prevent users from having to scroll past it to get to search results

## Before next release
